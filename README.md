# Coding_Ninjas_Superhero_Hunter


### Instead of making 3 pages 'Home Page', 'Superhero Page' and 'My favourite superheroes Page', all things will work inside one page. Because to go on another page, server needed to create routers for different pages. And only on the frontend making 3 pages and sending code differently for each page was getting difficult.

## Every function will work same with buttons :
- Home: For home page
- My Favorite Superheores: For showing favorite superheroes
- 'heart' on a card: to make the hero favorite
- 'arrow' on a card: to see more information
